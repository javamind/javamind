### Hi I'm Guillaume EHRET ðŸ‘‹

I fell into programming since my childhood a long time ago. At the start of my career I was told that to succeed you had to be a project manager, consultant, architect.... I tried each of these positions but my passion remains development and transmitting my passion.

So 10 years ago I created my own company [Dev-Mind](https://dev-mind.fr/) where I am free to be a senior developer ðŸ˜„. I try every day to help my customers to create user-centric solutions. I am often defined as a development craftman.

Inclusion, transmission, diversity and accessibility are subjects that are close to my heart and it is for this reason that I am proud to be part of several associations such as [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org/) and [Mixteen](https://mixteen.org/).

- my favorite languages are: Kotlin, Typescript and Java
- I love to develop Angular or VueJs frontend
- I am a Spring Framework expert for the Java/Kotlin backends
- I also develop on Android platform
- ...
